use my_first_db

- Create students collection.
db.createCollection("students")

- Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: ({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}})

- Create 5 students with the appropriate info.
db.students.insert({name: "Henry", home_state: "California", lucky_number: 21, birthday: {month: 7, day: 21, year: 1983}})
db.students.insert({name: "Ellie", home_state: "Florida", lucky_number: 4, birthday: {month: 107, day: 5, year: 2017}})
db.students.insert({name: "Charlene", home_state: "Illinois", lucky_number: 15, birthday: {month: 10, day: 25, year: 1982}})
db.students.insert({name: "Michael", home_state: "North Carolina", lucky_number: 23, birthday: {month: 4, day: 13, year: 1955}})
db.students.insert({name: "Cindy", home_state: "New York", lucky_number: 10, birthday: {month: 11, day: 19, year: 1990}})

- Get all students.
db.students.find().pretty()

- Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo).
db.students.find({home_state: "California"}).pretty()

- Get all students whose lucky number is greater than 3
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gt: 3}})

- Get all students whose lucky number is less than or equal to 10
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte: 10}})

- Get all students whose lucky number is between 1 and 9 (inclusive)
db.students.find({$and: [{lucky_number: {$gte: 1}}, {lucky_number: {$lte: 9}}]})

- Add a field named 'interests' to all student documents in the collection. The field should be an array and contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', MongoDB'. Add this field to all documents using a single command.
db.students.update({name: "Ellie"}, {$set: {interests: ["coding", "brunch", "MongoDB"]}})
db.students.update({name: "Cindy"}, {$set: {interests: ["coding", "brunch", "MongoDB"]}})

- Add some unique interests for each particular student into each of their interest arrays.
db.students.update({name: "Ellie"}, {$push: {interests:'gymnastics'}})
db.students.update({name: "Ellie"}, {$push: {interests:'arts and crafts'}})
db.students.update({name: "Cindy"}, {$push: {interests:'sewing'}})
db.students.update({name: "Cindy"}, {$push: {interests:'gardening'}})

- Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array.
db.students.update({name: "Cindy"}, {$push: {interests:'taxes'}})

- Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added.
db.students.update({name: "Cindy"}, {$pull: {interests:'taxes'}})

- Remove all students who are from California.
db.students.remove({home_state: "California"}, true)

- Remove a student by name.
- db.students.remove({name: "Michael"}, true)

- Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE)
db.students.remove({lucky_number: {$gt: 5}}, true)

- Add a field to each student document called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.
db.students.update({name: "Ellie"}, {$set: {number_of_belts:0}})
db.students.update({name: "Cindy"}, {$set: {number_of_belts:0}})

Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo).

Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned'

Remove the 'lucky_number' field.

Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date.
